# Thunderbird Localization: Source

> [!NOTE]
> This repository is essentially a fork of [Firefox-l10n-source](https://github.com/mozilla-l10n/firefox-l10n-source)

This repository contains the source locale messages for Thunderbird.
They are extracted from the active branches (Daily, Beta, Release, ESRs)
by a scheduled [GitHub action](./.github/workflows/update.yml),
which produces pull requests that are reviewed by the Thunderbird L10n team before merging.

From here, messages are exposed to translators in [Pontoon](https://pontoon.mozilla.org/).

Note that unless otherwise specified,
files in this repository have been processed from their Source Code Form,
and therefore following our [license](./LICENSE) (MPL-2.0)
do not necessarily carry a Source Code Form License Notice.
The Source Code Form for each such file is available from [mozilla/gecko-dev](https://github.com/mozilla/gecko-dev).
